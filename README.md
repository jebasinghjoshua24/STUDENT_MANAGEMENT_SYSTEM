# STUDENT_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM
Student Management System (Java OOP)
Description

This is a console-based Student Management System built in Java, demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, specifically encapsulation, classes, and objects. The system allows users to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student records using an array of Student objects.

It is designed as a menu-driven application, making it simple and interactive for learning OOP concepts in Java.

Features

Add Student: Store new student records with ID, Name, Age, Year, Semester, and Department.

Display All Students: List all saved students with full details.

Search Student by ID: Quickly find a student record using their unique ID.

Update Student: Edit existing student details.

Delete Student: Remove a student from the system.

Encapsulation: All student data fields are private and accessed through getter/setter methods.

Menu-Driven Interface: Easy to interact with, perfect for learning and testing OOP concepts.
